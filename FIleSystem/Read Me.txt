Design an in - memory file system:

Main functionalites:
1. Files, directories
2. metadata of files / directories: name, creation time, access time, etc.
3. operation: create, delete count file, etc.

The file system is tree - like:
e.g                           Dir
                        /   /   \    \
                       Dir File File Dir
                     /    \
                   Dir    File

Class:
Because File and Directory have same metadata, and some same basic operations. So we can create a abstract class:
Entry. File & Directory class will extend the Entry class.

File vs Directory:

1. File like the leaf node, cannot have child any more.  Directory can have subdirectories and subfiles.
2. File have String content. Directory doesn't have the String property.
3. They all contains the same metadata properties.


Entry: 
     Fileds: metadata:  protected Directory parent;
	       		protected long created;
			protected long lastUpdated;
			protected long LastAccessed;
			protected String name;
     Methods: constructor;
              boolean delete();
              abstract int size();
              String getFullPath();
              long getCreationTime();
              long getLastUpdatedTime();
              getLastAccessedTime();
              changeName(String n);
              getName();

File extends Entry:
     Fields: private String content;
	     private int size;
     Methods: constructor;
	      int size();
              String getContents();
              setContents(String c);

Directory extends Entry:
     Fields: private List<Entry> contents;
     Methods: constructor;
              List<Entry> getContents();
              int size();
              int numberOfFiles();
              boolean deleteEntry(Entry entry);
              void addEntry;
              Entry getChild(String component);

FileSystem: 
     Fields: private final Directory root;
     Methods: constructor;
              private List<Entry> resolve(String path);
              public void mkdir(String path);
              public void createFile(String path);
              public void delete(String path);
              public List<Entry> list(String path);
              public int count();

Finally, we have test class.

Note: when do the delete opration, we cannot delete it right away when iterating the directory.
      and to compare the object, we need to use .equals() method.
